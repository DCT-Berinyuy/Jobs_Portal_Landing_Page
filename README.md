# Jobs_Portal_Landing_Page
This job portal heir.me is an excellent project for practicing working with flex, client-side validation, and advance css. Remember to focus on accessibility, too!
  In this lab, I learned how to build a modern, responsive landing page using only HTML and CSS. I practiced using Flexbox for layout, semantic tags for accessibility, and basic styling techniques to enhance user experience. This project improved my frontend structuring skills and gave me confidence working with real UI mockups.
